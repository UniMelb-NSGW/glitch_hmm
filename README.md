This repository contains the current implementation of the HMM for detecting
pulsar glitches (`matab_code_logs_stable/`),  as well as wrapper code to call
it in a way that is a bit more friendly, and allow for the use of normal `.par`
and `.tim` files (`pulsar_hmm/` and `hmm_wrapper/`).

A working installation of `libstempo` (and `tempo2`) is required to use the latter.

More comprehensive documentation can be found in the `docs/` folder.

If you use this code, please cite [Melatos et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896...78M/abstract) and include a link back to this repository.
