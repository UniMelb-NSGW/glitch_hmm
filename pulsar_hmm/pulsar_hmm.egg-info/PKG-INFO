This is a python package which aims to implement the HMM glitch detection of Melatos et al. 2020
in Python. At the moment its main function is to provide a useful way to ingest .par and .tim
files and return an HMM. This HMM can then be passed to MATLAB for the actual computation.

This module also contains the seeds of a python implementation of the MATLAB code in `.../matlab_code_logs_stable`, but this is _not_ functional yet and should not be used.

You can install this package with `pip install .`

A working copy of [libstempo](https://github.com/vallis/libstempo) is required.
