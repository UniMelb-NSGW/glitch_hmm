This repository contains the current implementation of the HMM for detecting
pulsar glitches (`matab_code_logs_stable`),  as well as wrapper code to call
it in a way that is a bit more friendly, and allow for the use of normal `.par`
and `.tim` files (`pulsar_hmm` and `hmm_wrapper`).

A working installation of `libstempo` (and `tempo2`) is required to use the latter.
